# About
I made this website to share playlists. I'm not sure what people are using for music nowadays (let me know), but I wanted to make something independent of music streaming platforms (although they are embedded in here) to share the current music I'm listening to, as well as provide some unpolished commentary/ expose possibly new music to whoever's willing to explore this site.

### Navigation Tips:
Please listen in order ! For the best viewing experience, view on desktop instead of mobile. 
Each page has a YouTube playlist and TIDAL playlist embed at the top. Play the YouTube embed to listen to the whole playlist, and play the TIDAL embed to hear the playlist in 30s snippets of each track. Click on each container to learn more about each song & artist. "Expand All" expands all additional information, and "Collapse All" collapses it.
